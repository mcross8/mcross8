Hi! 

I'm [Matt Cross](https://mattcross.ca/). 

I'm a Systems Engineer at [Mission Control](http://missioncontrolspaceservices.com/) and an Adjunct Research Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Western University.](https://www.eng.uwo.ca/electrical/) 

I like planetary exploration robots, the science operations of those robots, and intelligence to increase the autonomy of their science operations.
